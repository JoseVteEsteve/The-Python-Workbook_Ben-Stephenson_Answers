"""The wavelength of visible light ranges from 380 to 750 nanometers (nm). While the
spectrum is continuous, it is often divided into 6 colors as shown below:

Exercise 54:Wavelengths of Visible Light 25

Color 		Wavelength (nm)
Violet 		380 to less than 450
Blue 			450 to less than 495
Green 		495 to less than 570
Yellow 		570 to less than 590
Orange 		590 to less than 620
Red 			620 to 750

Write a program that reads a wavelength from the user and reports its color. Display
an appropriate error message if the wavelength entered by the user is outside of the
visible spectrum."""
