"""In the previous question you converted from note name to frequency. In this question
you will write a program that reverses that process. Begin by reading a frequency
from the user. If the frequency is within one Hertz of a value listed in the table in
the previous question then report the name of the note. Otherwise report that the
frequency does not correspond to a known note. In this exercise you only need to
consider the notes listed in the table. There is no need to consider notes from other
octaves.
