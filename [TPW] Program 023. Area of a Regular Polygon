"""A polygon is regular if its sides are all the same length and the angles between all of
the adjacent sides are equal. The area of a regular polygon can be computed using
the following formula, where s is the length of a side and n is the number of sides:

    area = (n Ã— s^2)/(4 x tan(pi/n))

Write a program that reads s and n from the user and then displays the area of a
regular polygon constructed from these values."""

side_length = float(input("Please, introduce the length of a side of the regular polygon: "))

#area is computed
area = round((sides_number*side_length**2)/(4*math.atan(math.pi/sides_number)),3)
