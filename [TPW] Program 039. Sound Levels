"""The following table lists the sound level in decibels for several common noises.

Noise         Decibel level (dB)
Jackhammer      130
Gas lawnmower   106
Alarm clock     70
Quiet room      40

Write a program that reads a sound level in decibels from the user. If the user
enters a decibel level that matches one of the noises in the table then your program
should display a message containing only that noise. If the user enters a number
of decibels between the noises listed then your program should display a message
indicating which noises the level is between. Ensure that your program also generates
reasonable output for a value smaller than the quietest noise in the table, and for a
value larger than the loudest noise in the table."""
