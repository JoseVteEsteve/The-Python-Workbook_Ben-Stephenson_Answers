"""The following table contains earthquake magnitude ranges on the Richter scale and
their descriptors:

Magnitude 								Descriptor
Less than 2.0 						Micro
2.0 to less than 3.0 			Very minor
3.0 to less than 4.0 			Minor
4.0 to less than 5.0 			Light
5.0 to less than 6.0 			Moderate
6.0 to less than 7.0 			Strong
7.0 to less than 8.0 			Major
8.0 to less than 10.0 		Great
10.0 or more 							Meteoric

Write a program that reads a magnitude from the user and displays the appropriate
descriptor as part of a meaningful message. For example, if the user enters 5.5 then
your program should indicate that a magnitude 5.5 earthquake is considered to be a
moderate earthquake."""
