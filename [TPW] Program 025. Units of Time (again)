"""In this exercise you will reverse the process described in the previous exercise.
Develop a program that begins by reading a number of seconds from the user.
Then your program should display the equivalent amount of time in the form
D:HH:MM:SS, where D, HH, MM, and SS represent days, hours, minutes and seconds respectively. 
The hours, minutes and seconds should all be formatted so that they occupy exactly two digits, 
with a leading 0 displayed if necessary."""

total_seconds = int(input("Introduce the total amount of seconds: "))

#the amount of days, hours, minutes and seconds is computed now
#1 day is 24*3600 seconds, 1 hour is 3600 seconds and 1 minute is 60 seconds

days = int(total_seconds//(24*3600))
remaining_time = total_seconds%(24*3600)
hours = remaining_time//(3600)
remaining_time = remaining_time%3600
minutes = remaining_time//60
remaining_seconds = remaining_time%60

print(str(total_seconds) + " seconds displayed in the correct time are :" + str(days).zfill(2) + ":" + str(hours).zfill(2) + ":" 
+ str(minutes).zfill(2) + ":" + str(remaining_seconds).zfill(2))

#zfill(n) is a method used to complete a number position with a leading zero
