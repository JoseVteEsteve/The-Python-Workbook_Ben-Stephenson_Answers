"""The horoscopes commonly reported in newspapers use the position of the sun at the
time of oneâ€™s birth to try and predict the future. This system of astrology divides the
year into twelve zodiac signs, as outline in the table below:

Zodiac sign         Date range
Capricorn         December 22 to January 19
Aquarius          January 20 to February 18
Pisces            February 19 to March 20
Aries             March 21 to April 19
Taurus            April 20 to May 20
Gemini            May 21 to June 20
Cancer            June 21 to July 22
Leo               July 23 to August 22
Virgo             August 23 to September 22
Libra             September 23 to October 22
Scorpio           October 23 to November 21
Sagittarius       November 22 to December 21

Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her month and day of birth. Then
your program should report the userâ€™s zodiac sign as part of an appropriate output
message."""
