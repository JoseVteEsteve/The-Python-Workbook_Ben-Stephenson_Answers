"""In the previous exercise you created a program that converts a letter grade into the
equivalent number of grade points. In this exercise you will create a program that
reverses the process and converts from a grade point value entered by the user to a
letter grade. Ensure that your program handles grade point values that fall between
letter grades. These should be rounded to the closest letter grade. Your program
should report A+ for a 4.0 (or greater) grade point average."""
