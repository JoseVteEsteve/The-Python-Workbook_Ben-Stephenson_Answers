"""Electromagnetic radiation can be classified into one of 7 categories according to its
frequency, as shown in the table below:

Name 							Frequency range (Hz)
Radio waves 			Less than 3 × 109
Microwaves 				3 × 109 to less than 3 × 1012
Infrared light 		3 × 1012 to less than 4.3 × 1014
Visible light 		4.3 × 1014 to less than 7.5 × 1014
Ultraviolet light 7.5 × 1014 to less than 3 × 1017
X-rays 						3 × 1017 to less than 3 × 1019
Gamma rays 				3 × 1019 or more

Write a program that reads the frequency of the radiation from the user and displays
the appropriate name.
