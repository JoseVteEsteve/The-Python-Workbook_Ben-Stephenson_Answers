"""The year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. While the
exact dates that the seasons change vary a little bit from year to year because of the
way that the calendar is constructed, we will use the following dates for this exercise:

Season      First day
Spring      March 20
Summer      June 21
Fall        September 22
Winter      December 21

Create a program that reads a month and day from the user. The user will enter
the name of the month as a string, followed by the day within the month as an
integer. Then your program should display the season associated with the date that
was entered."""

month = input("Introduce the name of the month: ").title()
day = int(input("Introduce the number of the day: "))

if month == "January" or month == "February" or (month == "March" and day < 20):
	print("The season is Winter.")
elif (month == "March" and day >= 20) or month == "April" or month == "May" or (month == "June" and day < 21):
	print("The season is Spring.")
elif (month == "June" and day >= 21) or month == "July" or month == "August" or (month == "September" and day < 22):
	print("The season is Summer.")
else:
	print("The season is Fall.")
