"""The amount of energy required to increase the temperature of one gram of a material
by one degree Celsius is the material’s specific heat capacity, C. The total amount
of energy required to raise m grams of a material by ΔT degrees Celsius can be
computed using the formula:

                               q = mCΔT.

Write a program that reads the mass of some water and the temperature change
from the user. Your program should display the total amount of energy that must be
added or removed to achieve the desired temperature change.

Hint: The specific heat capacity of water is 4.186 J g◦C. Because water has a den-
sity of 1.0 gram per millilitre, you can use grams and millilitres interchangeably
in this exercise.

Extend your program so that it also computes the cost of heating the water. Elec-
tricity is normally billed using units of kilowatt hours rather than Joules. In this
exercise, you should assume that electricity costs 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Use
your program to compute the cost of boiling water for a cup of coffee."""

mass = float(input("Enter the mass of water in grams: "))
temperature_change = float(input("Introduce the temperature change in ºC: "))
total_energy = round(mass*4.186*temperature_change,3)
print("The total energy to heat {} grams of water with a temperature change of {} ºC is {} Joules".format(mass,temperature_change,total_energy))

#Extension
#Joules must be changed to kilowatt-per-hour, so that 1 J = 2.77778e-7 Kwh

energy_in_kwh = round(total_energy*0.000000277778,3)

#in the program is assumed that the time for boiling a cup of coffee are 5 minutes = 300 seconds
#the cost of electricity is calculated by multiplying the energy (in Kwh and transformed to kws) by the cost (in cents) and multiplying
#the total per 300 s (the assumed time to boil a cup of coffee)

energy_cost = round(energy_in_kwh*8.9/3600*300,5)

print("The cost of energy to boil a cup of coffe is",energy_cost,"cents.")
