"""In the United States, fuel efficiency for vehicles is normally expressed in miles-per-gallon (MPG). 
In Canada, fuel efficiency is normally expressed in liters-per-hundred kilometers (L/100 km). 
Use your research skills to determine how to convert from
MPG to L/100 km. Then create a program that reads a value from the user
