"""In the previous exercise you created a program that computed the area of a triangle
when the length of its base and its height were known. It is also possible to compute
the area of a triangle when the lengths of all three sides are known. Let s1, s2 and s3
be the lengths of the sides. Let s = (s1 + s2 + s3)/2. Then the area of the triangle
can be calculated using the following formula:

  area = (s × (s − s1) × (s − s2) × (s − s3))**1/2

Develop a program that reads the lengths of the sides of a triangle from the user and
displays its area."""

side1 = float(input("Please, introduce the length of the first triangle: "))
side2 = float(input("Please, introduce the length of the second triangle: "))
side3 = float(input("Please, introduce the length of the third triangle: "))

#s value is computed
s= (side1 + side2 + side3)/2

#the area is computed now
area = round((s*(s-side1)*(s-side2)*(s-side3))**0.5,3)
print("The area of a triangle with sides of {}, {} and {} meters is {} square meters.".format(side1,side2,side3,area))
